                <p>
                    The outbreak of disease-causing agents is continuously threatening
                    public health worldwide, particularly the viruses. Millions of people die due to the effects
                    of illness resulting from virus infection, and over the years more aggressive epidemics are
                    arising; the recent example being the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Host and pathogen are
                    the life entities involved in such infectious diseases. The relationship between these two
                    entities are crucial to the outcomes of infection and, therefore, host-pathogen interactions
                    (HPI) have been studied to better understand the whole infection progression. HPIs are
                    involved in every step of disease: from the initial pathogen transmission, through the
                    activation of the pathogenic mechanism used to overcome (or hijack) host cell defenses,
                    and to the pathogen becoming established and massively reproduce within the host system;
                    all these processes involve the interaction of host and pathogen proteins. Identification of
                    these protein-protein interactions (PPI) could help to unravel the disease pathways, provide
                    methods to improve resistance, and ultimately accelerate the development of drugs and
                    other therapeutics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowing about PPIs is important for drug target discovery because we can enhance or
                    disrupt these interactions to relieve diseases. To find about PPIs, there are high and low
                    throughput methods, which are costly and there is a tradeoff between scalability and
                    reliability due to high-throughput methods being able to output a lot of interactions, but
                    many can be false positives. On the other hand, low-throughput methods are very reliable,
                    but can detect a small number of interactions. This is where computational methods come
                    in handy to predict if a pair of proteins interact, which could save a lot of resources and
                    time.</p>

                    Malivhu lets the user input two protein sequences: the virus and the host proteins. In the background, 
                    it works in four phases: (I) it predicts whether the input sequence is an ssRNA(-) protein or not; 
                    (II) it predicts whether the protein comes from a coronavirus or not; (III) it predicts whether the protein
                    comes from MERS or SARS or other species; and (IV) runs a BLAST for all SARS proteins to find if they 
                    belong to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, and then it predicts whether both proteins interact or not.
